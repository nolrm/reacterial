# Spec

Write a component spec (Level 3 of the MD-first pattern) before any code is written.

The spec file lives **colocated** with the component it describes:
```
src/components/Button/
  Button.md     ← spec (written first)
  Button.tsx    ← code (written after spec is approved)
```

## What I'll Do

1. Ask for the component name and a brief description of its purpose
2. Scan existing components to understand project patterns and naming conventions
3. Create `<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.md` using `.contextkit/templates/component-spec.md`
4. Fill in Purpose, Responsibilities, Props/API, Logic & Behavior, and Dependencies based on your description
5. Present the spec for your review before any code is written

## How to Use

```
Spec a Button component that handles primary and secondary variants with loading state
Spec an AuthProvider that manages session state and exposes useAuth hook
Spec a DataTable with sortable columns, pagination, and row selection
```

## Process

1. **Understand** — Parse the description to identify purpose, props, and behavior
2. **Scan** — Check existing components for similar patterns or dependencies
3. **Draft spec** — Create `<ComponentName>/<ComponentName>.md` from template
4. **Fill** — Populate all sections based on description and codebase context
5. **Review** — Present the spec. Wait for approval before writing any code.

Once the spec is approved, use `create-component` to scaffold the implementation.

## Standards Applied

- `.contextkit/standards/architecture.md` — 3-level MD-first pattern
- `.contextkit/standards/code-style.md` — Naming conventions
